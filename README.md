# Cover Letter Automation

A Python package for ingesting job descriptions & resumes, and crafting cover letters that use the latter to satisfy the former.

## üöÄ Using

While the package is in theory pip-installable, it's not yet on PyPI. For now, you can clone the
repo and run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shippy/cover_letter_automation.git
cd cover_letter_automation
poetry install
```

Then, you should place your `resume.json` ([JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org), although in
principle it doesn't have to have that exact schema) in `resume/` and your job descriptions in
`jd/`. You can then run the following:

```bash
poetry run python init_session.py --resume resume/$RESUME_NAME.json --jd jd/$JD_NAME.md
# In theory, if you've placed your resume at resume/resume.json, you can omit that argument
```

Currently, due to the slightly ad-hoc nature of the agents, you'll need to run the above command for
each job description you want to generate a cover letter for. The cover letters will be placed in
`cover_letters/`.
