# Cover Letter Automation

A Python package for ingesting job descriptions & resumes, and crafting cover letters that use the latter to satisfy the former.

## üöÄ Using

While the package is in theory pip-installable, it's not yet on PyPI. For now, you can clone the
repo and run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shippy/cover_letter_automation.git
cd cover_letter_automation
poetry install
```

Afterwards, you will need to add your OpenAI API key (and, optionally, Bing API key) to a `.env`
file in the root of the project. You can [grab your Bing API key here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api), though do be warned that the volume of requests the agent will want to make possibly exceeds the free tier. If you don't have
a Bing API key, we'll automatically skip the web-search step. **Note that `CompanyResearcher` is 
mostly broken and doesn't work, so **not setting the `BING_API_KEY` is fine**.

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" > .env
# echo "BING_API_KEY=your_bing_api_key" >> .env
```


Then, you should place your `resume.json` ([JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org), although in
principle it doesn't have to have that exact schema) in `resume/` and your job descriptions in
`jd/`. You can then run the following:

```bash
poetry run python init_session.py --resume resume/$RESUME_NAME.json --jd jd/$JD_NAME.md
# In theory, if you've placed your resume at resume/resume.json, you can omit that argument
```

Currently, due to the slightly ad-hoc nature of the agents, you'll need to run the above command for
each job description you want to generate a cover letter for. The cover letters will be placed in
`cover_letters/`.
